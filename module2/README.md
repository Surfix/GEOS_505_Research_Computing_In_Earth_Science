# Introduction  to Git and Python

## 02.01: Module Overview and Learning Outcomes
### Module Overview
In this module we will learn some new or improve our existing skills around keeping project files (in this case some text files and some initial python source code files) under version control. Version control is an exceptionally useful tool to use that allows us to: 
1. keep progressive versions of our programs in a single location
2. edit and add to that code in a systematic way, and
3. collaborate with other people on a programming project in a way that allows for automated tracking of changes to the code. 

### Module Learning Outcomes
By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Describe how version control with git allows us to keep track of our modifications to our code, helps us keep our code backed up, and allows us to maintain code across several computers,
2. Use git to create a repository of code, document modifications to that repository, and recover your code in the event of an accidental deletion or hardware failure,  
3. Demonstrate how to use some basic libraries/modules in Python to create rudimentary figures and graphs.

## 02.02: Module reading and watching
### Resources for this Module
The following are the reading/viewing resources for this module

1. Read the Software Carpentry 'Version Control with Git' lesson [overview](https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/) and [git installation instructions](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git). 
2. Read this [Medium article](https://rabernat.medium.com/scientific-collaboration-and-project-management-in-github-d74f2255ae5f) from Ryan Abernathy, an Oceanographer at Columbia, on how he uses GitHub to collaborate [8 minutes]
3. Read this [Medium article](https://blog.jupyter.org/jupyterlab-is-ready-for-users-5a6f039b8906) about JupyterLab, a really powerful platform for creating 'notebooks' of Python code and text [5 minutes]
4. Read the Software Carpentry 'Plotting and Programming in [Python' lesson overview](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/) and [setup](http://swcarpentry.github.io/python-novice-gapminder/setup.html) and try to install Anaconda and Python if you can [20-50 minutes]

## 02:03: Module setup and preparation
### Software and Libraries We Will be Using
To prepare for this module, ensure that you have the following installed: 

1. Git for version control. Instructions for installing git on Windows/MacOS/Linux machines can be found on the [Software Carpentry Git installation instructions website](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#git). 
2. Install Anaconda on your machine. This will automatically ensure that you have Python 3.x installed, as well as JupyterLab. Instructions for installing Anaconda on Windows/MacOS/Linux machines can also be found on the [Software Carpentry Python installation instructions website](https://carpentries.github.io/workshop-template/#python).
