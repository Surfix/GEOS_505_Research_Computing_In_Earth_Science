# GEOS_505_Research_Computing_In_Earth_Science
This repo contains important notebooks, data and other files for GEOS 505- Research Computing In the Earth and Environmental Sciences that I am taking this fall 2022.

## Goal
To acquire knowledge and skills of using computing platforms, programming languages, and practises common in contemporary research to conduct data and computing-enabled research in the Earth and Environmental Sciences.
Skills to acquire include linux computing environment, version control using git and python programming. 


## Instructor
This course is taught by proffesor [Alejandro Flores](https://www.boisestate.edu/earth/staff-members/alejandro-n-flores/) of the Dept. of Geoscience, Boise State University.

## Course Structure
The class is divided into two units. The first unit is approximately 5 weeks in duration and the second unit is about 10 weeks in duration. 

Unit 1 is for skill building. The goal of this unit is to build and/or refine some basic competencies and proficiencies in the python programming language, applied to the analysis of environmental science data, that will be the foundation to the rest of the semester.

Unit 2 will focus on class climate dashboard project. The goal of this unit is to develop a minimum viable product (MVP) for a climate dashboard for Idaho.
